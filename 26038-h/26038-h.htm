<h2>Drawings and Pharmacy in al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;&#8217;s</h2>
<h2>10th-Century Surgical Treatise<br /><br /></h2>
<h4><i>by Sami Hamarneh</i><br /><br /></h4>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Probably the earliest independent work in Arabic Spain to embrace
the whole of medical knowledge of the time is the encyclopedic</i> al-Tasr&#299;f,
<i>written in the late 10th century by Ab&#363; al-Q&#257;sim al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;,
also known as Abulcasis. Consisting of 30 treatises, it is
the only known work of al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; and it brought him high prestige
in the western world.</i></p>

<p><i>Here we are concerned only with his last treatise, on surgery.
With its many drawings of surgical instruments, intended for the
instruction of apprentices, its descriptions of formulas and medicinal
preparations, and its lucid observations on surgical procedures, this
treatise is perhaps the oldest of its kind.</i></p>

<p><i>Scholars today have available a translation of the text and reproductions
of the drawings, but many of the latter are greatly modified
from the originals.</i></p>

<p><i>This study reproduces examples of al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;&#8217;s original illustrations,
compares some with early drawings based on them, and comments
on passages in the treatise of interest to students of pharmacy
and medical therapy.</i></p>

<p><img src="images/capital_t.png" class=
"floatLeft" alt="T" />HE INTRODUCTION OF THE WRITINGS
of Ab&#363; al-Q&#257;sim Khalaf ibn &#699;Abb&#257;s
al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;&mdash;better known as Abulcasis (d.
ca. 1013)&mdash;to Western Europe was through the
Latin translation of his surgical treatise (maq&#257;lah)
by Gerard of Cremona (d. 1187).<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The response to
this treatise, thereafter, was much greater than the
attention paid to the surgery of any of the three
renowned physicians of the Eastern Caliphate: al-R&#257;z&#299;
(Latin, Rhazes, d. ca. 925), the greatest clinician
in Arabic medicine; al-Maj&#363;s&#299; (Haly Abb&#257;s, d. 994),
the author of the encyclopedic medical work, <i>al</i>-<i>Malak&#299;</i>;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
<span class='pagenum'>84</span>and Ibn S&#299;n&#257; (Avicenna, 980-1037), the
author of the famous <i>al-Q&#257;n&#363;n f&#299; al-&#7788;ibb</i>, a codification
of the whole of medical knowledge. Because of the
widespread dissemination of this Latin version in
medieval Europe beginning with the latter part of
the 12th century, al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; attained more prestige
in the West than he did in Arabic Spain, his native
country, or in any other part of the Islamic world.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>The fame attached to this surgical treatise, the 30th
and last in al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;&#8217;s encyclopedic work <i>al-Ta&#7779;r&#299;f
Liman &#699;Ajiza &#699;an al-Ta&#700; l&#299;f</i>, is founded on certain merits.
The text is characterized by lucidity, careful description,
and a touch of original observation of the
surgical operations to which the treatise as a whole is
devoted.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; furnishes his own drawings of
the surgical and dental instruments he used, devised,
or recommended for a more efficient performance.
The illustrations were intended to provide instructional
material for apprentices&mdash;whom al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; calls his
children&mdash;as well as for the benefit of those who
would read the work later on.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The treatise is
<span class='pagenum'>85</span>probably the oldest one known today that contains

<p>This surgical treatise has been investigated, translated,
and commented upon by eminent historians
of medicine and surgery to whose works I shall refer
in this article. However, the pharmaceutic and
therapeutic details of the treatise have been somewhat
overlooked.</p>

<p>As to the various illustrations of the surgical instruments
(over 200 figures in all), an almost complete
representation of samples has been introduced by
Channing,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Leclerc,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Gurlt,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Sudhoff,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and others.
Nevertheless, a good number of the reproduced
drawings are greatly modified, most likely having been
influenced by earlier illustrations in several Latin and
vernacular versions of the treatise.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> This becomes
clearer on comparison with seven Arabic manuscripts
that have not been fully examined by Western
scholars before and that&mdash;in several instances&mdash;show
more authentic drawings of al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;&#8217;s surgical
instruments than any heretofore published.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>87</span>Al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; frequently introduces his treatises with
brief instructive and sometimes informative preludes.
However, in launching the last treatise of <i>al-Ta&#7779;r&#299;f</i> he
expounded in a most interesting and illuminating
manner the status of surgery during his time. He also
explains the reasons that forced him to write on this
topic and why he wished to include, as he did, precautions,
advice, instructional notes, and beautifully
illustrated surgical drawings. For example, the prelude
to the treatise mentions four incidents that he
witnessed, all ending with tragic results because of the
ignorance of physicians who attempted to operate on
patients without the proper training in anatomy and
surgical manipulation. "For if one does not have the
knowledge of anatomy," al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; protests, then
" ... he is apt to fall in errors that lead to death as
I have seen it happen to many."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; divides his surgical treatise into three
sections (abw&#257;b). In the first section (56 chapters)<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
he elaborates upon the uses and disadvantages of
cautery in general. And on the ground that "fire
touches only the ailing part ... without causing
much damage to surrounding area," as caustic medicine
does, he prefers cautery by fire (al-kay bi al-n&#257;r)
to cautery by medicine (bi al-daw&#257;).<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> This, he adds,
"became clear to us through lifelong experience, diligent
practice, and thorough investigations of facts."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>88</span>He also proposes that instruments made of iron are
more practical in many ways than those made of gold,
because often, when gold instruments are put in fire,
they either are not heated enough or are overheated,
causing the gold to melt.</p>

<p>Al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; gently refutes the superstition that
cautery is "good only in springtime," and states that
under the right conditions of the body&#8217;s humors it
could be used in all seasons."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Although he recommends
cautery rather highly, he never minimizes the
importance of treatment by drugs. Actually, he
encourages the use of drugs, before, with, and after
cauterization.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> For example, in chapter 16 on "the
cauterization of eyelid when its hair grows reversedly
into the eye," he recommends treatment by cautery
and by medicine. In cautery, the area where fire is
to be placed is marked with ink in the shape of a
myrtle leaf. In drug treatment, the caustic medicine
is applied to the eyelid over a paper in the shape of a
myrtle leaf (<a href="#f_2">fig. 2</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f_11" id="f_11" /><img src="images/i018.png" width="500" height="341" alt= "Figure 11."

<p>In chapter 17 the author refers to an ancient method
regarding cautery of the fistula in the inner corner of
the eye. After incising the fistula, one "dirham"
(derived from the Greek "drachma," which is equal
to about 2.97 grams)<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> of melted lead is poured into it
through a fine funnel used for cauterization (<a href="#f_3">fig. 3</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f_12" id="f_12" /><img src="images/i019.png" width="500" height="307" alt= "Figure 12."

<p><span class='pagenum'>89</span>In like manner, al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; discusses cautery of the
stomach and the "cold liver" in chapters 26 and 27,
respectively. The drawings therein represent shapes
of the burns on the skin (<a href="#f_4">fig. 4</a>) and marks of ink to be
drawn beneath the cartilage of the ribs (<a href="#f_5">fig. 5</a>) for the
purpose of spotting the area of operation. Here also
he describes carefully and clearly the methods of
applying cautery and the types, position, and number
of tools employed in each case. He likewise depicts
(in chapter 45) instruments used in the treatment
of hernia (<a href="#f_6">fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>The second section (b&#257;b), with about 99 chapters,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
deals with incision, puncturing, venesection, cupping,
surgery on abscesses, and the withdrawal of arrows
from the body. Al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; warns that ignorance in
such operations may lead to damage of an artery or
vein, causing loss of blood "by which life is sustained."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
Moreover, needle and thread (more than
one kind is mentioned) for the stitching of wounds are
repeatedly recommended.</p>

<p>According to al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;, foreign bodies that lodge
in the ear (chapter 6) are of four origins: (1) "mineral
stones" or substances resembling mineral stones
such as iron and glass; (2) plant seeds (chick-peas and
beans); (3) liquids, such as water and vinegar; and (4)
animals, such as fleas. Several instruments are recommended
for the removal of such foreign bodies&mdash;fine
tweezers shaped like a dropper (<a href="#f_7">fig. 7</a>), a syringe
with plunger-pump, and a tube made of silver or
copper (<a href="#f_8">fig. 8</a>). Also of interest to pharmacy and
therapy is the advice in regard to the use of lubricants
to be applied before administering these fine instruments
into the body&#8217;s cavities.</p>

<p>Chapter 24 is concerned with the treatment of the
polypus that grows in the nose. The various kinds
(including cancer growth), shapes, and colors of this
type tumor and its treatment by surgery or medicine
are described. A hollowed nose-dropper made of
metal in the shape of a small kerosene lamp<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> is suggested
(<a href="#f_9">fig. 9</a>). The dropper is held by its handle
while its contents are heated before use. Applying
heat to nose drops was probably proposed because it
serves two purposes: it allows easier flow of the
"duhn," or the fatty substance used, and it raises the
temperature of the drops to that of the body.</p>

<p>In his discussion on dental hygiene,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;
<span class='pagenum'>90</span>describes scrapers and dental forceps for teeth cleaning
and extraction (figs. <a href="#f_10">10,</a> <a href="#f_11">11</a>) and brings in a few points
of historical interest.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> He warns of the common error
of extracting the adjacent healthy tooth instead of the
ailing one due to the patient&#8217;s sense deception. For a
gargle he prescribes salt water, vinegar, and wine
(shar&#257;b). To stop hemorrhage he used blue vitriol
(al-z&#257;j)&mdash;copper sulfate in our modern terminology.</p>

<p>In chapter 33 al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; discusses bridge-making
for the consolidation of shaky teeth (<a href="#f_12">fig. 12</a>). He
prefers the use of stable gold over silver which, he says,
putrifies and rots in a short time. In a rational approach,
he also suggests that the fallen tooth itself, or
a similar one shaped out of a cow&#8217;s bone, be installed
and connected with adjacent, stable teeth by a bridge.</p>

<p>Now, turning to chapter 36, we find al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;
describing a knife-thin tongue depressor (<a href="#f_13">fig. 13</a>) that
he used to facilitate the examination of inflamed
tonsils and other swellings of the throat; it was made
of silver or copper. And in chapter 37 (chapter 34
in Bes. 503), he describes the excision of an inflamed
uvula by surgery. In the same chapter, he also mentions
the use of instruments made of steel. Of
pharmaceutical interest is the following free translation
of the formula he prescribes "as a milder treatment
by fumigation ... to be resorted to only when the
swelling is subsiding":<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Take pennyroyal [<i>Mentha pulegium</i> Linn.], absinthe

other end, which contains the nozzle, into the patient&#8217;s
mouth, allowing the vapor to rise up to the uvula. And
if you are not able to secure this instrument, take a straw

<p>Al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; repeats in chapter 53, on cancer, what
Greek physicians had said earlier, that cancer could
be removed by surgery only at its first stage and when
found in a removable part of the body, such as the
<span class='pagenum'>91</span>breast. Therefore, he confesses that neither he nor
any one else he knew of ever applied surgery with
success on advanced cancer.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Of special interest in chapter 59 is the metallic
"syringe" (<a href="#f_15">fig. 15</a>) used to inject medicinal solutions
into the bladder: "The hollow passage [of the syringe]
should be exactly equal to the plunger it contains and
no more, so that when such fluids from an excess of
humors are aspirated they will be drawn out, and
likewise when the solutions are injected they will be
pushed in easily." Such description of the use of a
"bladder syringe" in the late 10th century clearly
points to the practical and interesting approach to
surgery in <i>al-Ta&#7779;r&#299;f</i>. Moreover, his description of the
removal of a stone from the bladder&mdash;an operation
we now call lithotomy&mdash;is considered a contribution
to bladder surgery.</p>

<p>One of the earliest recorded operations for the
extractions of two dead fetuses from the womb is
clearly described in chapter 76. The account of this
case shows not only al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;&#8217;s intelligent approach
as a shrewd observer but also his clinical and surgical
ability.</p>

<p>Drawings of bulb-syringe instruments used for administering
enemas in ailments of the rectum and for
the treatment of diarrhea and colic are depicted in
chapter 83. The text describes several kinds of
syringes made of silver, porcelain, and copper in
various sizes (<a href="#f_16">fig. 16</a>). Of particular interest is an
illustration of a syringe, especially recommended for
children, to which a piece of leather (jildah) is
attached (<a href="#f_17">fig. 17</a>). This instrument is a precursor of
our modern bulb syringe.</p>

<p>In chapter 84 al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; turns to the treatment
of various wounds. He prescribes the following
powder formula for use: "Take olibanum [frankincense]
and dragon&#8217;s blood,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> two parts of each, and
three parts of slaked or unslaked lime. Pound them
well, pass through a sieve and apply the powder to
the wound." In cases of damaged blood vessels, he
tied the arteries by ligature, a practice of which he
was a pioneer. In another chapter he describes four
methods for suturing the intestines.</p>

<p>Al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;, being associated with war casualties
and writing his treatise about the end of the 10th
<span class='pagenum'>92</span>century, no doubt had the experience of dealing with
cases involving injuries caused by arrows. The text
in chapter 94 discloses his observations in elaborate
investigations regarding the extraction of various kinds
of arrows from the body.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Accordingly, several kinds
of hooks and forceps for removing arrows are described
and depicted in the treatise (see <a href="#f_18">fig. 18</a>). Al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;&#8217;s
mention of Turkish bows and arrows led Freind to
believe, erroneously, that the author of the treatise
must have lived in the 12th century,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> notwithstanding
the fact that Turkish bows and arrows were in common
use in the latter part of the 10th century.</p>

<p>The next chapter, on cupping, mentions the use of
cups made of horns, wood, copper, or glass, according
to circumstances and the availability of material.
The methods of treatment are divided into two kinds:
dry cupping, with or without fire, and wet cupping
(see <a href="#f_19">fig. 19</a>). He prescribes ointments and aromatic
and medicated waters to be applied before and after
cupping to facilitate healing. Only when cupping is
not possible, as on the nose, fingers, and similar parts
of the human body, does he propose the use of
leeches for treatment.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Evidently this is an indication
that he did not, as generally supposed, encourage
the widespread use of leeches.</p>

<p>The third and final section, of 35 chapters, deals
with the reduction, luxation, and treatment of injured
bones, including fracture of the pelvis. The advices
and warnings in the prelude of this section appear to
repeat some of al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;&#8217;s sayings that had been
covered in his previous introductions. The text, however,
presents many facets of interest to the health
<span class='pagenum'>93</span>professions. It elaborates upon the application of
various forms of bandages and plasters in a variety
of operations. Al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;&#8217;s detailed description relating
to fractures of bones is a fine anatomical
document of historical interest. He illustrates and
describes special methods for tying injured or broken
bones, and he suggests that bandages made of soft
linen be less and less tight as distance increases from
the injured place (chapter 1). For the protection of
areas adjacent to the injured part against contact
with edges of splints he advocates padding with soft
gauze and carded wool. In some cases, to guard
against swelling, he preferred a delay of one or more
days in applying bandages over splints. Al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;
also devised and depicted many kinds and shapes of
splints for use in simple and compound fractures of
the head, shoulders, arms, fingers, etc. (see <a href="#f_20">fig. 20</a>).
For example, in discussing the reduction of the
humerus, he recommends a splint consisting of a
smooth, thin stick bent in the shape of a bow
with two strings, each attached to one end of
the stick (<a href="#f_21">fig. 21</a>). The injured bone is then placed
in the middle of the bent splint for reduction while
the patient is seated on a chair. Tying is applied
only when there is no "hot" swelling (chapter 11).
One of the remarkable observations made in this section
is the description of the paralysis caused by fracture
of the spine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f_20" id="f_20" /><img src="images/i029.png" width="500" height="563" alt= "Figure 20."

<p>Of interest to historians of medical therapy and pharmacy
are the recipes for poultices that al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;
recommends for use over fractured bones. For example,
he gives the following recipe for one such
poultice: "Take the so-called 'mill&#8217;s dust' [ghub&#257;r
al-rah&#257;], which is the part of the wheat flour that
clings to the walls of the mill during grinding [lub&#257;b
al-daq&#299;q], and, without sifting away the bran, knead
<span class='pagenum'>94</span>with white-of-egg to a medium consistency, and
apply." Another, more elaborate, recipe calls for
10 dirhams each of the roots of wild pomegranate
[<i>Glossostemon bruguieri</i> D.C.], chickling vetch [the grass
pea, <i>Lathymus sativus</i>], and white marshmallow; 5
dirhams each of myrrh and aloes; 6 dirhams of white
gum Arabic [<i>Acacia</i>]; and 20 dirhams of bole [friable
earthy clay consisting largely of hydrous silicates of
aluminum and magnesium, usually colored red
because of impurities of iron oxide]. Procedure was
to pound all ingredients gently, pass them through
a sieve, and knead with water or white-of-egg (chapter
1).</p>

<p>The question arises as to whether al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; did
any human dissection. The answer is uncertain because
our knowledge of his life is fragmentary. However,
he gives no clue to the dissection of humans in
any of the 30 treatises of <i>al-Ta&#7779;r&#299;f</i>&mdash;his only known
writings&mdash;and there is no evidence that he practiced
it in secret. His upright attitude as a Muslim who
repeatedly emphasized his adherence to his faith suggests
that he relied completely on animal dissection
and the writings of his Greek-Roman and Islamic
predecessors. Physicians in both the Islamic domain
and in Christendom for many centuries were hostile
to the idea of human dissection for any purpose because
of their traditional socio-religious convictions,
considering it an unethical and undignified practice.
Perhaps it has been al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;&#8217;s original contributions
to surgery, his enthusiasm in emphasizing the
value of anatomical knowledge, and his recognition of
the necessity that only well-educated, well-trained
doctors should perform surgery that have led some
medical historians to wonder whether he did human
dissection at some time in his long years of experience.</p>


<div class="center"><big>In Summary</big></div>

<p>The few examples of illustrations of surgical instruments
given here indicate that the Arabic manuscripts,
in general, have preserved the original, oriental,
artistic features of the drawings in a way that has been
overlooked in Latin and vernacular versions of
<i>al-Ta&#7779;r&#299;f</i>.</p>

<p>In presenting his personal observations and original
ideas on surgery late in life, al-Zahr&#257;w&#299;, for the most
part, was inspired by a thorough acquaintance with
Greek and Arabic medical literature supplemented
by lifelong intelligent observation and experience.</p>

<p>Through its descriptions and illustrations, the surgical
treatise of al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; very likely played a
significant role in the designing of improved surgical
instruments in the Middle Ages. Also, the treatise no
doubt promoted the development of improved surgical
techniques in Islam and, through its translations,
promoted these techniques to an even greater extent
in the West, a fact that justifies the fame of this
treatise as the highest expression of the development
of surgery in Arabic Spain&mdash;a treatise whose influence
continued to the Renaissance. It contributed in no
small measure to the idea of equipping learned and
well-trained surgeons with the best surgical tools and
techniques of the time; moreover, it encouraged the
invention of new instruments to meet differing circumstances
and special conditions. These tools no
doubt greatly facilitated the work of the surgeon.</p>

<p>Throughout the text of <i>al-Ta&#7779;r&#299;f</i> al-Zahr&#257;w&#299; gave
careful attention to the importance of pharmaceutical
preparations in the healing art, including cases
requiring surgery.</p>
